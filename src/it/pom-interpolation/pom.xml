  <name>pom inheritance and interpolation IT of site distributionManagement url</name>
  <description>
    test of distributionManagement.site.url inheritance and interpolation
    step 1: inheritance assembly injects parent value with current artifactId appended
           gives "${site.repository}/pom-interpolation-artifactId" (not yet interpolated)
    step 2: model interpolation of ${*} variables
    
    Conclusion: even if current site.repository property ends with target/site-deployed,
    inheritance will append artifact id, then content will go to
    target/site-deployed/pom-interpolation-artifactId, which is not immediately intuitive
    
    This happens for the 5 urls in pom.xml,
    see http://maven.apache.org/ref/current/maven-model-builder/ for complete reference
    
    Notice that this is not tied to maven-site-plugin itself, but Maven model building:
    the IT could just echo $project.distributionManagement.site.url or the effective pom.
    But since users discover this feature through the maven-site-plugin, they first think
    it's a maven-site-plugin bug: no, there is no bug, and the cause is not in maven-site-plugin
    :)
